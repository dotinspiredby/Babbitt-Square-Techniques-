# Babbitt_Square_Techniques
simple class describing 12 tone techniques  


This code was created for study purposes and realizes all methods used in twelve-note composition. Named in honor of the mathematician and composer Milton Babbitt the Square describes all the methods used by the composers-serialists - contemporaries of Arnold Schoenberg, the basis of which was the theory of 12 non-repeating tones. The methods of the Class do the same thing, but apart from giving the full Square, it also can retrun the particular rows(prime, retrograde) and columns(inversion, retrograde-inversion).
